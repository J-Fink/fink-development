There are two ways to look at what a server is:
* The physical computer, whether it is offsite somewhere, or the computer you are writing code on.
* The software (computer program) that does SOMETHING (i.e. serves)

A **physical server** is a specialized computer that is made for the long haul. Think of commercial grade versus home owner grade.
